# metrics-clojure-splunk

A [metrics-clojure](https://github.com/sjl/metrics-clojure) reporter to use with [Splunk](http://www.splunk.com). Mostly copied from an existing reporter, and largely untested yet. Uses the [metrics-splunk](https://github.com/zenmoto/metrics-splunk) code, which does not have any maven presence. I have to figure out how to package that.
